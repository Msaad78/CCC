<h1>path</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>path</code> element is the most flexible drawing tool in SVG.</li>
  <li><code>path</code> element works similarly to polyline insofar as a series of points can be defined in a string.</li>
  <li>In addition to defiing points it's also possible to define how the points are connected together (with straight lines or curves) or not connected at all (by moving).</li>
</ul>
