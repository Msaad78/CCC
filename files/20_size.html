<h1>Image Size</h1>
<ul>
  <li><code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes can be used to define the physical size of the image in pixels (picture elements).  If you were to save a bitmap copy of the finished image, this is the size it would be.</li>
  <li>This <a href="three_rect_size.svg">example</a> is the same as the <a href="three_rect.svg">previous</a> example, but, notice that the border is a different size because it is surrounding two images with different dimentsions.</li>
</ul>
