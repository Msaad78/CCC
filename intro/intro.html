<h1>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</h1>
<ul>
  <li>SVG is a markup language for images.</li>
  <li>SVG images use elements as building blocks, just like HTML.</li>
  <li>SVG is great for creating diagrams, icons, and user interface components.  It is not well suited to representing photographs, which are better served using bitmaps.</li>
  <li>In many cases, SVG images are smaller and more versatile than a bitmap of the same thing.  For example...
    <ul>
      <li>
        This is a bitmap image that is <code>2289</code> bytes in size.
        <img src="rectangles.png" alt="three rectangles" />
      </li>
      <li>
        This is an identical SVG image, however it is only <code>291</code> bytes - over seven times smaller.
        <img src="rectangles.svg" alt="three rectangles" />
      </li>
      <li>SVG images can also include animation and user interaction, so their potential should become apparent.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
